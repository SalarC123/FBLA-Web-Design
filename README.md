## [Delta Drivers](https://deltadrivers.netlify.app)

Our business provides delivery drivers that can pick up anything from groceries, prescription medicine, or even guests for a party. Users can choose to be either riders or drivers, and then they can interact with other users who they want to help or who they need help from. Drivers can make take on tasks for certain people and then can receive a rating and payment for their service. Riders make posts detailing what they need, and then drivers can scour these posts to determine who they want to assist. 

Users need to start by making an account first. Once they do this, they can request a ride, or they can use the contact us tab to request driver status. Users can then view their dashboard to keep track of upcoming rides. Users can also always view the merch tab which currently displays a shirt, a hoodie, and some sweatpants with a Delta Drivers logo imprinted on them. These products, alongside the social media platforms mentioned on the intro page, are used for marketing purposes.
